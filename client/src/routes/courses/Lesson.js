A UI element that is not currently supported out of the box with Flutter is a click wheel, or knob, or radial control, rotatable circle, or whatever you want to call it. The following snippet demonstrates how to take a circular container, then detect which direction the user is rotating (clockwise or counter clockwise) and its velocity. 
Full [wheel demo source code](https://github.com/fireship-io/216-flutter-ipod/blob/master/lib/wheel.dart). 

#### üëâ Detect Pan Gestures

Use a [GestureDetector](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html) to wrap a container with a BoxShape.circle. Every pan event on the circle will emit data with information about the user's movement. 

#### üí´ Calculate Rotational Movement

Think of a wheel as four separate quadrants like topRight, bottomRight, bottomLeft, and topLeft. For each quadrant, then are four different directions the user can move: up, down, left, or right. We can calculate the change in the user's movement by looking at the *delta*, then adjust it based on the quadrant in which it occurred. 

#### üèÑ Add Velocity

Adding velocity will make this UI element feel more natural if it controls a scrollable view. The faster the user pans, the higher the velocity. Simply multiply the rotational change by the delta distance.
